# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest commit on the `master` branch is fully supported. For all other commits or tags, please use the code at your own risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please do **not** use issues. Instead, please open a request in security advisories under security to help keep to vulnerability private and others safe. Please expect to wait up to one week before your request is reviewed, or within days if the request is high or critical. If the security vulnerability is not directly related to the code in this repository and instead is related to a dependency, it is declined. Otherwise, it is considered.
